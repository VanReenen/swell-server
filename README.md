# Swell Server
The idea behind swell-server is get accurate surf swell data from Open-Mateo.com

To check out the front-end, start the server and check out http://localhost:7777

### TODOs
- Add API call to get location's latitude and longitude.
- Add proper front end for graphing. Currently, HTML is used and starts up on localhost.
